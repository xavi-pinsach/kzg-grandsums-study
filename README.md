# Grand Sums Study
![Tests](https://github.com/xavi-pinsach/kzg-grandsums-study/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

This repository is a study about the grand-sums proposal by Héctor Masip / Polygon zkEvm. It explores the concept and implementation of grand-sums instead grand-product.

To be able to compare the performance of grand-sums and grand-product, we have implemented both. The grand-product protocol can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/-5URcycYTlOgJTt3rCMrpw).
